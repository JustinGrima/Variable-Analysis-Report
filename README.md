## Parents Combined Education Level and their Effect on Student Academic Performance.

### Dataset Overview

This project analyzes the "Student Performance Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which tabulates student achievement in secondary education from two Portuguese schools in 2014. The dataset consists of 1,044 observations and 35 variables, including student demographics, academic performance, and parental education levels. The dataset was preprocessed by merging two separate CSV files, representing student performance in mathematics and Portuguese subjects.

### Project Overview

The project investigates the impact of combined parental education levels (PCEL) on student academic performance. The objectives include:

Classifying parents' combined education levels (PCEL).
Analyzing student academic performance based on PCEL.
Exploring other variables that may influence student performance relative to PCEL.
The analysis was conducted using RStudio, employing various data manipulation, visualization, and summary techniques. The results revealed that while higher PCEL generally correlates with better academic performance, there are notable exceptions, such as students with lower PCEL who received more family educational support or expressed a strong desire for higher education.
